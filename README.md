Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene
Project Overview:
This project involves a detailed bioinformatics analysis of the human Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) gene, which encodes a proinflammatory cytokine involved in inflammation and immune response. The analysis includes sequence download, translation, open reading frame (ORF) identification, sequence composition analysis, transcription factor binding site prediction, functional motif search, coding/non-coding region prediction, and sequence file format conversion.

Key Objectives:

Download and visualize the human TNF gene sequence from NCBI.
Translate the TNF gene DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.
Identify Open Reading Frames (ORFs) within the gene.
Analyze the nucleotide composition and calculate GC content.
Predict transcription factor binding sites using the PROMO tool.
Identify functional motifs using MEME Suite.
Predict coding and non-coding regions with GENSCAN.
Convert the TNF gene sequence between FASTA and PHYLIP formats.
Technologies & Tools:

BioEdit for sequence editing, translation, and ORF identification.
PROMO for transcription factor binding site prediction.
MEME Suite for motif discovery.
GENSCAN for coding/non-coding region prediction.
Outcome:
The project demonstrates the practical application of bioinformatics tools for comprehensive sequence analysis, enhancing understanding of the structural and functional aspects of the TNF gene.
